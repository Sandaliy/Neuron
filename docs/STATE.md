# Project state

Where the project stands right now. This file replaces reading `neuron-plan.md` and `phase-*.md`.
Update this document at the end of a substantial implementation session when the current state has
materially changed.

Last updated: 2026-09-12, after Phase 6 closure on `main`.

## Now

Phase 6 is complete on `main`. The release contains writable decks, note editing and browsing, shared
card planning, chunked imports, and persistent Deleted/Restore UI for soft-deleted decks and notes. The
5,000-note list passes the unchanged 55 fps budget, and the shipped collection, recovery, import, and
keyboard UX passed real-iPhone acceptance. A real non-production 5,000-note import also passed after a
committed chunk response was intentionally lost: resume produced 5,000 notes and cards, one batch, no
duplicates, a usable destination deck, and the documented undo boundary remained true.
The completed collection release also separates organizational Folders from leaf study Decks. Migration
0012 preserves legacy mixed nodes as same-ID Folders and moves their own Notes into deterministic
same-named child Decks while retaining Note, Card, and Review IDs and history. Server-owned deletion
operations govern subtree recovery; permanent deletion retains immutable Reviews and history-safe
tombstones. Library, destination pickers, Deleted, and import copy use the new model.

The stabilized `main` branch has protected pull-request delivery, required CI and Vercel checks, and
isolated preview data. PR #12 and the follow-up safety fix PR #13 are merged. Trusted main-only
production migration verification is active: the production journal was current after merge, so the
workflow verified it and skipped migration. Production Vercel compatibility checks use the restricted
`neuron_app` and `neuron_auth` roles; `/health` and `/db-check` are schema-aware and healthy. The
owner-only `DATABASE_URL_OWNER` credential remains confined to the protected GitHub
`production-migrations` environment and is absent from Vercel and runtime environments.
Phase 7 Daily Study is the current milestone and immediate next work.

## Next

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. Build the Phase 7 Daily Study session and card reveal flow.
2. Add response recording, honest intervals, recent-answer undo, and useful study presets.
3. Cover phone/desktop keyboard, touch, speech fallback, and review-history behavior for the study loop.
=======
1. Review and commit the collection integrity work, then open a protected PR.
2. After merge, run migration 0012 through the production workflow and verify compatibility.
3. Complete real-iPhone acceptance for collection, recovery, import and keyboard flows.
4. Continue the remaining Phase 6 direction-control, browser and screenshot coverage, mobile-keyboard
   acceptance, and large-import acceptance work as separate workstreams and release slices where useful.
5. Run the full milestone gates when closing Phase 6.

## Open threads

- The long-lived Preview database is intentionally empty and shared by preview deployments. Resetting it
  or moving to one database branch per pull request remains a later automation task.
- The note-list performance fix preserves selection across virtual mounts, refreshed row data and native
  keyboard activation. Targeted browser checks pass in both themes at phone and desktop widths.
- Browser checks and real-iPhone acceptance cover the shipped collection, recovery, import, and keyboard
  flows.
- Import duplicates use a default plus row overrides in the bounded preview. Only a unique same-type
  match can merge. Ambiguous or incompatible matches inherit Skip instead of Merge, with visible reasons.
  Merge fills schema-defined blanks and grammar leaves under a write lock, preserves existing metadata,
  cards and reviews, and refuses card removal. In-page Resume reuses the original row IDs and decisions.
  Undo removes batch-created notes/cards only; merged additions stay, as stated in completion and undo copy.
  Targeted database and browser tests cover these boundaries. Large-import interruption/resume acceptance
  passed against the non-production database at 5,000 notes.
- Existing-note type conversion uses a separate empty target draft, schema validation and explicit Apply.
  Cancel leaves the saved note unchanged; same-type fields and tags still autosave. Shared reconciliation
  replaces cross-type cards with new IDs and fresh schedules. Answered-card removal requires explicit
  confirmation, with review rows preserved. Real database tests verify rollback of note/cards/revisions;
  focused phone/desktop browser tests cover all target schemas, cancellation, confirmation and retry.
  Existing notes move only through list selection; full direction/ladder controls remain intentionally
  deferred to the study-time direction and preset UX in Phase 7.
- The note list exposes exact source filtering and per-row live-card summaries. Persistent Deleted/Restore
  UI now covers soft-deleted decks and notes.
- Server restore integrity is verified by 22 real-database regression cases. Decks restore individually,
  parent-first. Note restore uses explicit card deletion provenance, preserves schedules and reviews,
  and reports cards left deleted. Historical and independently deleted cards remain deleted. Sync follows
  the same dependency and provenance boundaries. Migration 0011 adds the conservative false default
  without historical attribution.
- `stash@{0}` remains a historical backup of earlier Phase 6 local work.
- Collection restoration uses explicit deletion operation IDs, never timestamps or revision equality.
  Independently deleted descendants remain deleted. Legacy deletions without provenance restore
  individually. Note restoration retains `deleted_with_note` attribution for Cards. Permanent
  deletion prevents restoration through repositories and sync without rewriting Reviews.
- `stash@{0}` remains a historical backup of earlier Phase 6 local work.
- The production API is in `iad1` while users and web requests enter through Europe. Region alignment
  remains deferred because the database must move with the API.
- Mail delivery is disabled. `MAILER=log` is the only configured sender.
- `sync_conflicts` records losing versions but the web app has no recovery screen.
- The production web bundle is about 596 KB before gzip. Code splitting remains deferred.
- Dependency alerts include `nanoid` 3.3.17 and the Drizzle tooling version of `esbuild`.
- `drizzle-kit check` could not run locally because Node returned `uv_os_get_passwd ENOMEM`; the
  escalation retry was rejected by automatic approval review. Migration tests and generated snapshot pass.
