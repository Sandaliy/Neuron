# Project state

Where the project stands right now. This file replaces reading `neuron-plan.md` and `phase-*.md`.
Update this document at the end of a substantial implementation session when the current state has
materially changed.

Last updated: 2026-09-20, Phase 7 persistent learning and composition release.

## Current release slice

The `work/phase7-product-polish` worktree continues the merged PR #22 checkpoint. English-only
presentation preserves stored locale data. Today emphasizes real ready/time/review/new information
and reveals planning controls through Adjust. Daily Study and Practice share a dominant reading card
and thin progress treatment; Library drag retains exact placement with a full-row lift and quiet targets.

Deck settings now control default Daily Study participation (missing means included). Today can choose
an exact temporary subset, including paused Decks, before server planning. Counts, estimates, admission,
Waiting in and actual cards share that scope. No decks selected is distinct from caught up. Deterministic
new-material composition prevents a large Deck from starving other selected Decks.

Migration 0015 adds persistent per-Deck Practice runs and immutable Restart learning receipts/events.
Restart preserves IDs/history and excludes Known/excluded Notes, suspended/deleted cards and Practice.
Practice persists rounds/completion independently of FSRS and reconciles live membership. Import waits
for destination prefetch; affected lists show empty copy only after a successful settled request.

Focused fresh-schema verification: 39 core/shared/API/database tests passed, including restart/replay,
Practice, scoped planning, unchanged schedules/history, and Deck fairness. Chromium/WebKit phone
interaction checks preserve Undo, Practice reload, scope, rapid delete/restore, and touch drag. Broader
release verification and protected PR checks are recorded in the delivery report. Physical iPhone
acceptance of this slice remains outstanding; browser evidence is not a substitute.

Final local release verification covers 960 passing unit/API/core/shared tests across the resumed
run, 58 reviewed visual checks, the repaired browser interactions, and 31 Chromium/WebKit phone
checks (one platform-specific skip). Typecheck, lint, build, formatting, migration schema checks,
behind-schema/restricted-role migration safety and owner-free Preview verification pass. Default
scroll performance measured 58.7 fps against the unchanged 55 fps budget. One fresh-install journal
test remains locally blocked by Windows `EPERM` when renaming `packages/shared/dist`, including an
isolated retry; the protected Linux migration job must establish that remaining evidence.

Advanced drills, typed expansion, listening/speech, Phase 8 offline sync, Phase 9 waves/triage and
progressive directions, and Phase 10 analytics remain deferred.

The same release includes collapsible vocab Grammar, stable boolean controls, structured English
principal parts/countability, German complement patterns and preposition POS, preserved legacy grammar,
and populated grammar combinations in persistent Practice. Local panels open immediately; Today and
Practice retain known content during background refresh. Reveal/advance uses existing short motion.
Scheduled grammar drills and the response-mode follow-up remain explicitly deferred in ROADMAP.

## Now

Phase 6 is complete on `main`. The release contains writable decks, note editing and browsing, shared
card planning, chunked imports, and persistent Deleted/Restore UI for soft-deleted decks and notes. The
5,000-note list passes the unchanged 55 fps budget, and the shipped collection, recovery, import, and
keyboard UX passed real-iPhone acceptance. A real non-production 5,000-note import also passed after a
committed chunk response was intentionally lost: resume produced 5,000 notes and cards, one batch, no
duplicates, a usable destination deck, and the documented undo boundary remained true.
The completed collection release also separates organizational Folders from leaf study Decks. Migration
0012 preserves legacy mixed nodes as same-ID Folders and moves their own Notes into deterministic
same-named child Decks while retaining Note, Card, and Review IDs and history. Server-owned deletion
operations govern subtree recovery; permanent deletion retains immutable Reviews and history-safe
tombstones. Library, destination pickers, Deleted, and import copy use the new model.

The stabilized `main` branch has protected pull-request delivery, required CI and Vercel checks, and
isolated preview data. PR #12 and the follow-up safety fix PR #13 are merged. Trusted main-only
production migration verification is active: the production journal was current after merge, so the
workflow verified it and skipped migration. Production Vercel compatibility checks use the restricted
`neuron_app` and `neuron_auth` roles; `/health` and `/db-check` are schema-aware and healthy. The
owner-only `DATABASE_URL_OWNER` credential remains confined to the protected GitHub
`production-migrations` environment and is absent from Vercel and runtime environments.
Phase 7 Daily Study is the current milestone. Its backend/core session foundation provides a
deterministic time-based first-appearance plan, workload-backed and explainable new-card admission,
an explicit one-off override that does not change long-term settings, and a fair due-preserving retry
pool. Study now plans visibly from one-off time and recognition/recall choices, keeps reveal and advance
local after the plan arrives, offers append-only recent-answer Undo, and ends with a useful summary.
Practice provides configurable front/back rounds without Review or schedule writes. The collection slice
adds atomic exact-position touch/mouse placement, committed swipe deletion, targeted rapid recovery,
compact headers and navigation paths, and live-dependency filtering so deleted collections cannot enter
Today or Study.

| 6        | Writable collections, recovery, import, Folder/Deck integrity, and real-device acceptance      |

## Next

1. Re-run the gesture-heavy acceptance pass on the physical iPhone and production domain after preview delivery.
2. Add the intentionally deferred rich drill families, typed production tolerance, listening and speech work.
3. Continue review-history presentation and accessibility work without weakening session fairness or replay.

## Open threads

- The long-lived Preview database is intentionally empty and shared by preview deployments. Resetting it
  or moving to one database branch per pull request remains a later automation task.
- The note-list performance fix preserves selection across virtual mounts, refreshed row data and native
  keyboard activation. Targeted browser checks pass in both themes at phone and desktop widths.
- Browser checks and real-iPhone acceptance cover the shipped collection, recovery, import, and keyboard
  flows.
- Import duplicates use a default plus row overrides in the bounded preview. Only a unique same-type
  match can merge. Ambiguous or incompatible matches inherit Skip instead of Merge, with visible reasons.
  Merge fills schema-defined blanks and grammar leaves under a write lock, preserves existing metadata,
  cards and reviews, and refuses card removal. In-page Resume reuses the original row IDs and decisions.
  Undo removes batch-created notes/cards only; merged additions stay, as stated in completion and undo copy.
  Targeted database and browser tests cover these boundaries. Large-import interruption/resume acceptance
  passed against the non-production database at 5,000 notes.
- Existing-note type conversion uses a separate empty target draft, schema validation and explicit Apply.
  Cancel leaves the saved note unchanged; same-type fields and tags still autosave. Shared reconciliation
  replaces cross-type cards with new IDs and fresh schedules. Answered-card removal requires explicit
  confirmation, with review rows preserved. Real database tests verify rollback of note/cards/revisions;
  focused phone/desktop browser tests cover all target schemas, cancellation, confirmation and retry.
  Existing notes move only through list selection; full direction/ladder controls remain intentionally
  deferred to the study-time direction and preset UX in Phase 7.
- The note list exposes exact source filtering and per-row live-card summaries. Persistent Deleted/Restore
  UI now covers soft-deleted decks and notes.
- Server restore integrity is verified by 22 real-database regression cases. Decks restore individually,
  parent-first. Note restore uses explicit card deletion provenance, preserves schedules and reviews,
  and reports cards left deleted. Historical and independently deleted cards remain deleted. Sync follows
  the same dependency and provenance boundaries. Migration 0011 adds the conservative false default
  without historical attribution.
- Collection restoration uses explicit deletion operation IDs, never timestamps or revision equality.
  Independently deleted descendants remain deleted. Legacy deletions without provenance restore
  individually. Note restoration retains `deleted_with_note` attribution for Cards. Permanent
  deletion prevents restoration through repositories and sync without rewriting Reviews.
- `stash@{0}` remains a historical backup of earlier Phase 6 local work.
- The production API is in `iad1` while users and web requests enter through Europe. Region alignment
  remains deferred because the database must move with the API.
- Mail delivery is disabled. `MAILER=log` is the only configured sender.
- `sync_conflicts` records losing versions but the web app has no recovery screen.
- The production web bundle is about 596 KB before gzip. Code splitting remains deferred.
- Dependency alerts include `nanoid` 3.3.17 and the Drizzle tooling version of `esbuild`.
- `drizzle-kit check` could not run locally because Node returned `uv_os_get_passwd ENOMEM`; the
  escalation retry was rejected by automatic approval review. The generated journal and snapshot chain
  is internally consistent; the real-database migration suite still requires a throwaway test database.
